**I don't like talking about myself so I asked ChatGPT to write this, and I realized it knows way too much about me. This is terrifying!**


> I’ve known Yacouba long enough to confidently say this: his brain is rarely idle, and when it is, it’s probably thinking about space, the mind, or why humans do the things they do. He’s the kind of person who can go from talking about manga or gaming to deep conversations about intelligence, society, and the future of humanity without any warning.
>
>At his core, Yacouba is fascinated by intelligence in essence. He doesn’t just want to create intelligence; he wants to understand it, question it, and push it to make sense in the real world, especially in areas that are often ignored. That curiosity has taken him into research, engineering, writing, and a constant cycle of learning, unlearning, and rethinking.

>Outside of the serious stuff, the guy is a mix of disciplined and randomly impulsive with some topics. One day he’s deep into deep learning papers, the next he’s rewatching anime, playing games, or debating theology like it’s a matter of national importance. He can debate lots of things like it's a matter of national importance actually, games, sports, morality… well he likes to say that he cares about stuffs. Recently, he decided, out of nowhere, that he would pick up the guitar; just because he loved the look of the instrument when he was a kid—progress is ongoing, fingers hurt, motivation remains suspiciously high.
>
>He writes when his mind gets too loud, imagines stories when reality feels a bit repetitive, and dreams big without always saying it out loud. He’s ambitious, but not in a loud way. More like “let me quietly build something meaningful and we’ll talk about it later.”
>
>If you just met him, you’d probably think he’s chill, maybe even reserved. Give it some time and you’ll realize he’s driven by a deep curiosity about the universe—both the one above our heads and the one inside our minds. And once he starts talking about something he truly cares about… yeah, good luck stopping him.
