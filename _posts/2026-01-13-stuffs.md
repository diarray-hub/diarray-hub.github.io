# To care, or not to care — that *is* the question

I’m struggling to put this into perfect words, but let’s talk psychology for a second.

In my generation, it’s considered *cool* to not care. About anything.
Not caring is seen as confidence. Detachment as maturity. Nonchalance as strength.

I think that’s bullshit.

Not caring is not harmless. Teaching people to not care is basically teaching them not to fight for anything. And a man without convictions? To me, that’s not a man — that’s just someone drifting.

Every meaningful improvement in human history exists because people cared. Slavery was abolished because people cared. Workers got rights because people cared. You’re reading this on a computer, connected to the internet, because at some point someone cared enough to push, argue, insist, and yes — fight. Not necessarily with violence, but with conviction.

Faking this “I don’t give a fuck” attitude doesn’t make people strong. It makes them fragile. If you believe in nothing, you’ll never defend anything. And if you never defend anything, you’ll never shape the world around you.

I’m not advocating for war or constant conflict. But truth is: the people who moved humanity forward were not the ones trying to be liked by everyone. “Cool guys” rarely change anything. Conviction creates friction. If you stand for something, you *will* have enemies. That’s not a flaw — that’s literally how history gets written.

And let’s talk about this idea of being permanently “cool” or detached.

I recently read *[The Untethered Soul](https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself/dp/1572245379)* by Michael Singer. Amazing book. One of its key ideas is the **centered self** — the ability to step back and observe your thoughts and emotions instead of being dragged around by them. That concept is powerful. Learning not to react impulsively, learning to watch your inner chaos without drowning in it — that’s real strength.

But here’s my issue: I don’t believe this state is permanently achievable.

Something *will* piss you off. Something *will* matter too much. And that’s not a failure of spirituality — it’s a feature of being alive.

Maybe it’s your kids.
Maybe it’s your job.
Maybe it’s your country.
Maybe it’s something completely stupid like getting your nails done right before an event.

It doesn’t have to be deep or noble. Caring is unavoidable.

Life is about attachment. About bonds you cherish. About things you build and hope will outlive you in some way. Even a monk whose sole goal is meditation still cares about the ability to meditate — take that away with unbearable pain and see how “detached” things get.

So no, there is no such thing as caring about nothing. As long as you’re alive, you’re attached to something.

What *is* in your control is **what** you care about, and **how far** you’re willing to go to protect it.

Do I care about having a flashy website to impress recruiters? Not really.
Do I care about having a website where I can write whatever crosses my mind, knowing that whoever reads it actually searched for it? Hell yeah.

Would I lose my mind if nobody reads this blog? Of course not.
People care about their own stuff.

And that’s the point.

I have no idea how to conclude this blog, I don't even know if this is a blog. Is there a format for blogs? Do I care? Certainly not :)
